= Steps-Taken

Logbook of relevant steps taken.

[NOTE]
For local setup, refer to `readme.adoc`. This file is intended to understand how the project itself was set up/bootstrapped. Once all the structures described here are in place the instructions in `readme.adoc` provide a more direct path to get things up and running.

- ensure suitable Python version is available and on path
`python -V`
- create new virtual environment
`python -m venv venv --copies`
- activate env
`source venv/bin/activate`
- create `requirements-dev.txt` with `pip-tools` (for `pip-compile` to handle transitive dependencies)
- install dev requirements
`pip install -r requirements-dev` 
- create `requirements.in` with `langchain` and `streamlit`
- lock dependencies/create `requirements.txt` based on `requirements.in`
`pip-compile requirements.txt`
- install requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
